## SkribblAI

### This project aims to build a RNN and cGAN powered web app to mimic the famous skribbl.io game

### Here are some cool things about the project
* Both the CNN and the cGAN will be trained on the entire QuickDraw dataset(all the 345 classes)
* I am using the Syracuse University Orange Grid GPU cluster to train my model


### Here are new technlogies that I shall be exploring with this project
* HTContor: This is what the GPU Cluster runs on. The Clusters make use of unused computational resources accross campus to run my training jobs when GPUs become available
* Tensorflow: To build my CNN and cGAN
